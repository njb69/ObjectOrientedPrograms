The card class: has specific values enumerated for suit and rank allowed that be assigned via custom ctr. these values cannot be
		changed once the card is constructed, and can only be accesed with provided getters.

The deck class: features a custom constructor that creates a deck based on whether or not to use jokers, and whether ace is high or low
		the deck is stored as a vector of cards that can be shuffled
		

The player class: utilizes 2 vectors of cards for play hand and return hand. it gives the player the option to return their won card to 
		  the top or bottom of their return hand. the class has an int value that will only be changed by member functions (no function
		  assigned specifically to it). if 0, the player has no remaining cards. the move deck function is a helper and shouldn't be used
		  directly.

The game class: has 2 players and a deck. the game mechanics are run when a game obj is created and .playGamed. the deal
		function is used by .playGame only.
