PROJECT MILESTONE 3

I got the program to compile and play chess

I added the card and player classes so that when an opponents piece is taken during chess they recieve it's card, 
	at the end of chess they play war with the cards they won

I spent a ton of time trying to make the program more abstract and error proof by adding a piece struct with variant inside to represent a type for each piece with
	it's color, moves, etc. but it wouldnt compile yet so thats comming soon 
	
I got a lot of the SFML in place but the pieces dont actually move bc I ended up rewriting everything and it took forever (under the hood it works though).


I added file for the textures, and another for the event listener class.
