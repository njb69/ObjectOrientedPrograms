PROJECT MILESTONE 3

I got the program to compile and play war

I added the card and player classes so that when an opponents piece is taken during chess they recieve it's card, 
	at the end of chess they play war with the cards they won

I spent a ton of time trying to make the program more abstract and error proof by adding a piece struct with variant inside to represent a type for each piece with
	it's color, moves, etc. but it wouldnt compile yet so thats comming soon 
	
(I am also working on getting SFML to compile in my enviornment I didnt forget)

The next step is to make it safer in general, as there are way to many places a user could accidentally change a card or piece value midgame
